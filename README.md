# I'm Miguel Figuera Quintero.

I'm a Web Developer that finished The Odin Project curriculum.
I did the rails path and now Im trying to end the Node.js Path too.

I am currently enrolled at the **_Universidad Nacional Experimental de las Telecomunicaciones e Inform√°tica_** (UNETI) on Venezuela. My goal is to pursue a comprehensive education and ultimately become a skilled Software Engineer.

You can contact me through [here by phone](https://wa.me/584241727988) or [using linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-quintero725/).

My set of tools are:

1. JS, NodeJs, Express, React, Nextjs.
2. Ruby, Rails.
3. Python (for other stuff and not precisely webDevelopment).
4. Postgres, mySql, sqlite.
5. Digital Ocean.
6. Firebase.
7. Some docker.
8. Linux.

If you do not desire to wander in my repos, you can check [my page](https://miguelfiguera.github.io/miguelfiguera/#contact) to see the best (told by me) projects that I have done
in the pass year.

You can think that I'm self taught, but I will have to say like Arnold (yeah, Schwarzenegger) that _there is no self-made man_ because I owe getting this far to a lot of people. Even my pets get some credit too.

My previous experience is working as web developer for **AlphaComputer** and **Sistemas Globales ARC**, I'm currently employed on **R&R Advisor** as an IT & Software Developer. Also I have some freelance work as a FullStack Developer on NextJS and Ruby on Rails. I am eager to learn and grow in this community. I like to tackle new challenges and I'm looking for opportunities to do it.'.

I wish you well, fellow coder.

M.F.Q.
